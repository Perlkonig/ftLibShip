# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v2.0.1] - 2023-04-08

### Fixed

* Area defense systems now render properly in Beta orientation.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-04-07

### BREAKING CHANGE

Bays have been reworked so the `capacity` property is indeed as described. The mass is calculated by using the ratios given in the rules. But a `ratio` property has also been added so you can customize the mass-to-capacity ratio in a given scenario. The number displayed on the SSD is the capacity of the bay, and the mass is calculated by multiplying the capacity by the ratio.

If you have any saved ships that include bays, load them, correct the capacity, and resave.

### Added

* New `orientation` property lets you now choose "beta" orientation, where all firing arcs are rotated 30 degrees clockwise. All three forward arcs fire starboard and all three aft arcs fire port.

### Fixed

* CPV now correctly incorporates hull integrity. (Thanks, @mandalon!)

## [v1.3.1] - 2023-01-16

### Fixed

* Fixed the NPV calculation to include the ship's base mass.

## [v1.3.0] - 2022-12-31

### Added

* Added the "boat bay," intended to carry light non-combat vehicles like shuttles, dropships, and survey craft (see *Continuum*, p. 110). I'm sorry, but gunboats themselves are still unsupported.
* Added "assault shuttle" to the list of available fighters (see *Continuum*, pp. 75â€“76). The builder will allow robot assault shuttles, but they are really only legal if your universe allows purely robotic boarding parties. Human boarders cannot access a robotic fighter rack.

### Fixed

* There are some fighter combinations that are not valid (e.g., light fighters can't have the "heavy" modification). Checking invalid boxes will now automatically uncheck the box.

## [v1.2.1] - 2022-12-30

### Fixed

* Fixed long-range kgun glyphs to have black backgrounds instead of white. (Thank you, @shadowmouse!)

## [v1.2.0] - 2022-12-30

### Added

* Added a boolean `civilian` flag that changes the number of built-in DCPs (1/50 mass as opposed to 1/20).

### Changed

* Added a base font to the rendered SSD (Fira Sans).
* The `evaluate` function now flags duplicate IDs.

### Fixed

* Fixed a display bug where bays of different masses all showed the same capacity.

## [v1.1.0] - 2022-11-12

### Added

* Added `invaders` property to track boarding parties.
* Added `renderSvg` and `renderUri` functions to produce on-demand linear SSDs, including embedded styles and text resizing (in-browser use only).

## [v1.0.2] - 2022-10-06

### Fixed

* Fixed a display bug I introduced when you have screens of different explicit levels.

## [v1.0.1] - 2022-10-05

### Added

* Somehow "pulsers" never made it into the schema! Added them.
* You can now explicitly assert the level of a specific defensive screen system. I read the rules as saying the number of individual systems determined your screen level (maxing out at 2), but there are other compatible interpretations. Setting the level as `undefined` uses the level 2 glyphs but the level 1 points. Explicitly setting the level will adjust both the glyph and the points.
* Added gameplay-only fields to fighters so their form is codified (`number` and `skill`).
* Added a `uuid` field to the schema for the use of other tools. It's not needed at the building phase, just at the gameplay phase.
* Added a `silhouette` field to the schema.

### Fixed

* Plasma bolt launchers are now correctly restricted to one per fifty mass.

## [v1.0.0] - 2022-09-24

* Initial release of the standalone code. Verified working with the ship builder.
* Some minor mechanical corrections were made to the schema.
* Validation and evaluation code added to the root module.
* Unit test scaffolding in place, but coverage is minimal.
