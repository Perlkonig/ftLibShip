# Full Thrust Ship Library

This is a TypeScript library representing the schema/type for a Full Thrust ship description along with utilities for validating and graphically rendering it. It is made to be reused by other tools, right now just the [Full Thrust Ship Builder](https://github.com/Perlkonig/ftShipBuilder), which is now live.

The API is very unstable! I am still figuring things out. You have been warned.
